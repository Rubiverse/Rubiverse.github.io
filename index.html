        About Rubik’s Cube Where’s the Rubik’s Cube from? Who invented it?
        Looking for more info on the Rubik’s Cube? You’ve come to the right
        place! The Rubik’s Cube was invented in 1974 by Ernõ Rubik, a Hungarian
        architecture professor. Rubik later used the Cube as a learning exercise
        to teach his students about 3-dimensional spaces. Little did he know his
        “Magic Cube” (as he originally named it) would become one of world’s
        most famous puzzles of all time! By the 1980’s, the Rubik’s Cube was a
        worldwide craze selling millions of Cubes every year and cementing its
        legacy into pop culture. Featured in The Simpsons, The Big Bang Theory,
        a Spice Girls music video, and major Hollywood movies, the popularity of
        the Rubik’s Cube continued to grow around the world.
